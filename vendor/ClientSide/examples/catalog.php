/*
 * ENVIRONMENT
 * Server environment that you want to use: sandbox or production.
 * Default: 'sandbox'
 */

/*
 * VERBOSE
 * Verbose (true|false), enable this option and a full output will be shown.

/*
 * FILTERS
 * This function will add filters to your search, you will be able to send only
 * the filters that we expect to:
 *  - (enum) drm:
 *      "yes": Will return only DRM protected ebooks.
 *      "no": Will return only unprotected ebooks.
 *
 *  - (int) image_width: The width that you want your covers come. We recommend that you
 *                       search in your store, the maximum image size and set it here.
 *
 *  - (int) image_height: The height that you want your covers come. We recommend that you
 *                        search in your store, the maximum image size and set it here.
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 *  WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU ONLY SET THE HEIGHT *OR* THE WIDTH OF THE IMAGE, TO KEEP THE ASPECT
 *  RATIO IN PROPORTION OF THE ORIGINAL COVER. SETTING BOOTH, HEIGHT AND WIDTH CAN MESS AROUND
 *  WITH THE RATIO AND DISTORT THE IMAGE.
 *
 * EXAMPLES:
 *  To get only UNPROTECTED ebooks:
 *      $catalog->filters( array('drm' => 'no') );
 *
 *  Setting the max height size (IN PIXELS):
 *      $catalog->filters( array('image_height' => 1100) );
 *
 *  This functions accepts more than one filters:
 *      $catalog->filters( array('image_height' => 1100, 'drm' => 'no') ); // THIS CODE WILL PRODUCE: ONLY UNPROTECTED EBOOKS AND WITH 1100px OF HEIGHT ON THE COVER
